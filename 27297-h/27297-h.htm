<h2>PATH FLOWER</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">A red-cap</span> sang in Bishop's wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lark o'er Golder's lane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I the April pathway trod<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bound west for Willesden.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At foot each tiny blade grew big<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And taller stood to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every leaf on every twig<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was like a little ear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As I too paused, and both ways tried<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To catch the rippling rain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So still, a hare kept at my side<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His tussock of disdain,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Behind me close I heard a step,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A soft pit-pat surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking round my eyes fell deep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into sweet other eyes;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><span class="i0">The eyes like wells, where sun lies too,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So clear and trustful brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a bubble warning you<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That here's a place to drown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How many miles?" Her broken shoes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had told of more than one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answered like a dreaming Muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I came from Islington."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So long a tramp?" Two gentle nods,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then seemed to lift a wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And words fell soft as willow-buds,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I came to find the Spring."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A timid voice, yet not afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In ways so sweet to roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it with honey bees had played<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And could no more go home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her home! I saw the human lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I heard the hucksters bawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stifled with the thickened air<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of bickering mart and stall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><span class="i0">Without a tuppence for a ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her feet had set her free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rags, that decency defied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seemed new with liberty.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she was frail. Who would might note<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The trail of hungering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for an hour she had forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In wonder of the Spring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So shriven by her joy she glowed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It seemed a sin to chat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A tea-shop snuggled off the road;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why did I think of that?)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, frail, so frail! I could have wept,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But she was passing on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I but muddled "You'll accept<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A penny for a bun?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then up her little throat a spray<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of rose climbed for it must;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wilding lost till safe it lay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hid by her curls of rust;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><span class="i0">And I saw modesties at fence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With pride that bore no name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So old it was she knew not whence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It sudden woke and came;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But that which shone of all most clear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was startled, sadder thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should give her back the fear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of life she had forgot.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And I blushed for the world we'd made,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Putting God's hand aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till for the want of sun and shade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His little children died;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And blushed that I who every year<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With Spring went up and down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must greet a soul that ached for her<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With "penny for a bun!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Struck as a thief in holy place<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose sin upon him cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watched the flowers leave her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The song go from her eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><span class="i0">Then she, sweet heart, she saw my rout,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And of her charity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hand of grace put softly out<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And took the coin from me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A red-cap sang in Bishop's wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lark o'er Golder's lane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, alone, still glooming stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And April plucked in vain;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till living words rang in my ears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sudden music played:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Out of such sacred thirst as hers</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>The world shall be remade.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Afar she turned her head and smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As might have smiled the Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humble as a wondering child<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I watched her vanishing.<br /></span>

<h2>THE PIPER</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">I met</span> a crone 'twixt wood and wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who pointed down the piper's road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shaken staff and fearsome glance,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ware, ware the dance!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when the piper me did greet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind, the wind was in my feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose and leaf on eager boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unvestalled them of dew-writ vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I as light as leaf and rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Danced to the summer's close.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now every tree is weary grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of singing birds there is not one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, all the world droops into grey,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O piper Love, must thou yet play?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wildest note of all he blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fast my worn feet flew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><span class="i0">Old is the year, the leaf and rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are long, long gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So chill, so chill the grey wind blows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through heart and bone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No grasses warm the winter ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wound my feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with unwearied fingers yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold, undelayed on stop and fret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmercifully sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The piper plays....<br /></span>

<h2>TO A HERMIT THRUSH</h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Dweller</span> among leaves, and shining twilight boughs<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of gods dost serve with such unfaltering vows?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Weave me a time-fringed tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slumbering, haunted trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And star-sweet fragrances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No day defiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bowering nights innumerable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nestling hours breath-nigh a dryad's heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sleeping yet was wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dream-beat that thou mad'st a part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy dawn-fluting; ay, and keep'st it still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striving so late these godless woods to fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With undefeated strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in one hour build the old world again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wast thou found singing when Diana drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her skirts from the first night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst feel the sun-breath when the valleys grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm with the love of light,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span class="i0">Till blades of flower-lit green gave to the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery that made sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth forever,&mdash;strange and undefined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As life, as God, as this thy song complete<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That holds with me twin memories<br /></span>
